## **Personal Reflection**
Module 1 taught me the foundation of the different factors that make up cybersecurity. Before starting, I thought cybersecurity was simply about defending against hackers — now I understand it’s about protecting data and ensuring technology can be used safely by everyone.  

From the perspective of an **IT Management major**, this module showed me how cybersecurity connects to the world of business and technology. Learning about the **CIA Triad** and how it supports confidentiality, integrity, and availability helped me see how cybersecurity acts as a foundation of trust within businesses.  

One major takeaway I had was understanding the many roles within cybersecurity and how they work together to protect information systems. These roles showed me how much **technical skill and strategic thinking** are required in the industry — qualities that align well with my business and IT background. I can envision myself contributing from a management perspective by leading security initiatives, coordinating response efforts, and ensuring alignment between organizational goals and technical teams.  

Another key takeaway was the emphasis on **ethics and responsibility**. I appreciated the focus on maintaining integrity, doing what’s right, and continuing to adapt in a fast-changing industry. This reminded me that cybersecurity is more than defending systems — it’s about upholding ethical standards and accountability in every decision.  

Overall, this first module showed me that cybersecurity is a field where my **business mindset and technical interests intersect**. It’s reassuring to know that the work done in this field directly contributes to creating a safer digital environment for everyone.
